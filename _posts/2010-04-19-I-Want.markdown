<p>I want an earth free from quarrel</p>
<p>so I would rest soundly and not rattle</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I want a person who is very special</p>
<p>that thou would support me in my deadliest battles</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I want to share my thoughts</p>
<p>don't you know, good moments can't be bought</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I want a teacher who who can teach me to loose</p>
<p>because winning everytime is not like a cooked goose</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I want some console and some game disks</p>
<p>as I don't have enough money to frisk</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Alas in this dire need of want</p>
<p>I myself don't know how much I have lost</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Above all I(still want) my life back</p>
<p>As god has given us a chance to live without time lags</p>
