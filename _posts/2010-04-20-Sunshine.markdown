<p>A window opened</p>
<p>and came the arrow of brightness</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>It hit me hard somewhere deep in my heart,</p>
<p>just to make me reliase its prowess.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I felt my mind was boggled and soul shrovelled</p>
<p>but it was a, transition, from darkness</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Like a bull's power, it was an uncontrolled reaction</p>
<p>to baptize me from an unholy Bacchus.</p>
